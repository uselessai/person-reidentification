abstract: ['In intelligent video surveillance system, person re-identification is a key technology. In order to address the problem, the decrease in performance of person Re-Id lead by the skew pedestrian images, this paper proposes the affine transform for skew correction based on generative adversarial network (GAN) method for multi-camera person re-identification (Re-Id). Firstly, an effective GAN is proposed to guide the spatial transformer network (STN) to learn affine transform parameters for skew correction in an adversarial way, and STN is adopted as the preprocessing model for Re-Id to reduce influence of variations in person posture. Then, features are extracted by a deep convolutional neural network from input images which are corrected by STN, and finally results can be obtained by measuring similarity between features. Besides, in the proposed GAN, a classification model and related loss functions are introduced to reduce the damage to the key features of pedestrian during skew correction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments conducted on the skew pedestrian dataset.'],

abstract: ['Recently, GAN based method has demonstrated strong effectiveness in generating augmentation data for person re-identification (ReID), on account of its ability to bridge the gap between domains and enrich the data variety in feature space. However, most of the ReID works pick all the GAN generated data as additional training samples or evaluate the quality of GAN generation at the entire data set level, ignoring the image-level essential feature of data in ReID task. In this paper, we analyze the in-depth characteristics of ReID sample and solve the problem of "What makes a GAN-generated image good for ReID". Specifically, we propose to examine each data sample with id-consistency and diversity constraints by mapping image onto different spaces. With a metric-based sampling method, we demonstrate that not every GAN-generated data is beneficial for augmentation. Models trained with data filtered by our quality evaluation outperform those trained with the full augmentation set by a large margin. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method on both supervised ReID task and unsupervised domain adaptation ReID task.'],

abstract: ['Person re-identification (ReID) is one of the commonly used criminal investigation methods in reconnaissance. Although the current ReID has achieved robust results on single domains, the focus of researches has shifted to cross-domain in recent years, which is caused by domain bias between different datasets. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is used to realize the image style transfer of different datasets to alleviate the effect of cross-domain. However, the existing GAN-based models ignore complete expressions and occlusion of pedestrian characteristics, resulting in low accuracy in feature extraction. To address these issues, we introduce a cross domain model based on feature fusion (FFGAN) to fuse global, local and semantic features to extract more delicate pedestrian features. Before extracting pedestrian features, we preprocess feature maps with a feature erasure block to solve an occlusion issue. Finally, FFGAN enables a more complete visual description of pedestrian characteristics, thereby improving the accuracy of FFGAN in identifying pedestrians. Experimental results show that the effect of FFGAN is significantly improved compared with some advanced cross-domain ReID algorithms.'],

Therefore, cross-domain Re-ID has received more and more attention. In this paper, a novel cross-domain Re-ID method combining supervised and unsupervised learning is proposed, which includes two models: a triple-condition generative adversarial network (TC-GAN) and a dual-task feature extraction network (DFE-Net). We first use TC-GAN to generate labeled images with the target style, and then we combine supervised and unsupervised learning to optimize DFE-Net. Specifically, we use labeled generated data for supervised learning. In addition, we mine effective information in the target data from two perspectives for unsupervised learning. To effectively combine the two types of learning, we design a dynamic weighting function to dynamically adjust the weights of these two approaches. To verify the validity of TC-GAN, DFE-Net, and the dynamic weight function, we conduct multiple experiments on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID.

abstract: ['Person re-identification (person Re-Id) aims to retrieve the pedestrian images of the same person that captured by disjoint and non-overlapping cameras. Lots of researchers recently focused on this hot issue and proposed deep learning based methods to enhance the recognition rate in a supervised or unsupervised manner. However,there are two limitations that cannot be ignored: firstly, compared with other image retrieval benchmarks, the size of existing person Re-Id datasets is far from meeting the requirement, which cannot provide sufficient pedestrian samples for the training of deep model; secondly, the samples in existing datasets do not have sufficient human motions or postures coverage to provide more priori knowledges for learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised pose augmentation cross-view person Re-Id scheme called PAC-GAN to overcome these limitations. We firstly present the formal definition of cross-view pose augmentation and then propose the framework of PAC-GAN that is a novel conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) based approach to improve the performance of unsupervised corss-view person Re-Id. Specifically, the pose generation model in PAC-GAN called CPG-Net is to generate enough quantity of pose-rich samples from original image and skeleton samples. The pose augmentation dataset is produced by combining the synthesized pose-rich samples with the original samples, which is fed into the corss-view person Re-Id model named Cross-GAN. Besides, we use weight-sharing strategy in the CPG-Net to improve the quality of new generated samples. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to enhance the unsupervised cross-view person Re-Id by pose augmentation, and the results of extensive experiments show that the proposed scheme can combat the state-of-the-arts with recognition rate.'],

Although some supervised methods have achieved favorable performance, they are far from practical application owing to the lack of labeled data. Thus, unsupervised person re-ID methods are in urgent need. Generally, the commonly used approach in existing unsupervised methods is to first utilize the source image dataset for generating a model in supervised manner, and then transfer the source image domain to the target image domain. However, images may lose their identity information after translation, and the distributions between different domains are far away. To solve these problems, we propose an image domain-to-domain translation method by keeping pedestrians identity information and pulling closer the domains distributions for unsupervised person re-ID tasks. Our work exploits the CycleGAN to transfer the existing labeled image domain to the unlabeled image domain. Specially, a Self-labeled Triplet Net is proposed to maintain the pedestrian identity information, and maximum mean discrepancy is introduced to pull the domain distribution closer.

Existing person re-id methods rely mostly on implicit solutions, such as seeking robust features or designing discriminative distance metrics. Compared to these methods, human solutions are more straightforward. That is, imagine the appearance of the target person under different camera views before matching target person. The key idea is that human can intuitively implement viewpoint transfer, noting the association of the target person under different camera views but the machine failed. In this paper, we attempt to imitate such human behavior that transfer person image to certain camera views before matching. In practice, we propose a conditional transfer network (cTransNet) that conditionally implement viewpoint transfer, which transfers image to the viewpoint with the biggest domain gap through a variant of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). After that, we obtain hybrid person representation by fusing the feature of original image with the transferred image then perform similarity ranking according to cosine distance.

The art implicitly addresses this problem by learning a camera-invariant descriptor subspace. In this paper, we explicitly consider this challenge by introducing camera style (CamStyle). CamStyle can serve as a data augmentation approach that reduces the risk of deep network overfitting and that smooths the CamStyle disparities. Specifically, with a style transfer model, labeled training images can be style transferred to each camera, and along with the original training samples, form the augmented training set. This method, while increasing data diversity against overfitting, also incurs a considerable level of noise. In the effort to alleviate the impact of noise, the label smooth regularization (LSR) is adopted. The vanilla version of our method (without LSR) performs reasonably well on few camera systems in which overfitting often occurs. With LSR, we demonstrate consistent improvement in all systems regardless of the extent of overfitting. We also report competitive accuracy compared with the state of the art on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-re-ID. Importantly, CamStyle can be employed to the challenging problems of one view learning and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in person re-identification (re-ID), both of which have critical research and application significance.

With MpRL, the generated data will be used as the supplementary of real training data to train a deep neural network in a semi-supervised learning fashion. To build the corresponding relationship between the real data and generated data, MpRL assigns each generated data a proper virtual label which reflects the likelihood of the affiliation of the generated data to pre-defined training classes in the real data domain. Unlike the traditional label which usually is a single integral number, the virtual label proposed in this paper is a set of weight-based values each individual of which is a number in (0,1] called multi-pseudo label and reflects the degree of relation between each generated data to every pre-defined class of real data. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out by adopting two state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in our experiments to verify the effectiveness of MpRL. Experiments demonstrate that by assigning MpRL to generated data, we can further improve the person re-ID performance on five re-ID datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03, VIPeR, and CUHK01. The proposed method obtains +6.29{\%}, +6.30{\%}, +5.58{\%}, +5.84{\%}, and +3.48{\%} improvements in rank-1 accuracy over a strong CNN baseline on the five datasets, respectively, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.'],

abstract: ['Person re-identification (re-id) is a cross-camera retrieval task which establishes a correspondence between images of a person from multiple cameras. Deep learning methods have been successfully applied to this problem and have achieved impressive results. However, these methods require a large amount of labeled training data. Currently, the labeled datasets in person re-id are limited in their scale and manual acquisition of such large-scale datasets from surveillance cameras is a tedious and labor-intensive task. In this paper, we propose a framework that performs intelligent data augmentation and assigns the partial smoothing label to generated data. Our approach first exploits the clustering property of existing person re-id datasets to create groups of similar objects that model cross-view variations. Each group is then used to generate realistic images through adversarial training. Our aim is to emphasize the feature similarity between generated samples and the original samples. Finally, we assign a non-uniform label distribution to the generated samples and define a regularized loss function for training. The proposed approach tackles two problems 1) how to efficiently use the generated data and 2) how to address the over-smoothness problem found in current regularization methods. The extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets show that our regularization method significantly improves the re-id accuracy compared to existing methods.'],

abstract: ['We address the problem of person re-identification (reID), that is, retrieving person images from a large dataset, given a query image of the person of interest. A key challenge is to learn person representations robust to intra-class variations, as different persons can have the same attribute and the same persons appearance looks different with viewpoint changes. Recent reID methods focus on learning discriminative features but robust to only a particular factor of variations (e.g., human pose), which requires corresponding supervisory signals (e.g., pose annotations). To tackle this problem, we propose to disentangle identity-related and -unrelated features from person images. Identity-related features contain information useful for specifying a particular person (e.g., clothing), while identity-unrelated ones hold other factors (e.g., human pose, scale changes). To this end, we introduce a new generative adversarial network, dubbed identity shuffle GAN (IS-GAN), that factorizes these features using identification labels without any auxiliary information. We also propose an identity-shuffling technique to regularize the disentangled features. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IS-GAN, significantly outperforming the state of the art on standard reID benchmarks including the Market-1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-reID.

For learning robust person features, the pose variation of person images is one of the key challenges. Existing works targeting the problem either perform human alignment, or learn human-region-based representations. Extra pose information and computational cost is generally required for inference. To solve this issue, a Feature Distilling Generative Adversarial Network (FD-GAN) is proposed for learning identity-related and pose-unrelated representations. It is a novel framework based on a Siamese structure with multiple novel discriminators on human poses and identities. In addition to the discriminators, a novel same-pose loss is also integrated, which requires appearance of a same persons generated images to be similar. After learning pose-unrelated person features with pose guidance, no auxiliary pose information and additional computational cost is required during testing. Our proposed FD-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three person reID datasets, which demonstrates that the effectiveness and robust feature distilling capability of the proposed FD-GAN.'],

abstract: ['Person re-identification (re-id) aims to match a certain person across multiple non-overlapping cameras. It is a challenging task because the same persons appearance can be very different across camera views due to the presence of large pose variations. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel unified person re-id framework by exploiting person poses and identities jointly for simultaneous person image synthesis under arbitrary poses and pose-invariant person re-identification. The framework is composed of a GAN based network and two Feature Extraction Networks (FEN), and enjoys following merits. First, it is a unified generative adversarial model for person image generation and person re-identification. Second, a pose estimator is utilized into the generator as a supervisor in the training process, which can effectively help pose transfer and guide the image generation with any desired pose. As a result, the proposed model can automatically generate a person image under an arbitrary pose. Third, the identity-sensitive representation is explicitly disentangled from pose variations through the person identity and pose embedding. Fourth, the learned re-id model can have better generalizability on a new person re-id dataset by using the synthesized images as auxiliary samples. Extensive experimental results on four standard benchmarks including Market-1501 [69], DukeMTMC-reID [40], CUHK03 [23], and CUHK01 [22] demonstrate that the proposed model can perform favorably against state-of-the-art methods.'],

Moreover, a nearest-neighbour loss is proposed instead of the common L1 and L2 losses in order to match the details of the generated image with the target image. We test our approach using photos of persons in different poses and we compare our method with previous work in this area showing state-of-the-art results in two benchmarks.

abstract: ['Being a cross-camera retrieval task, person re-identification suffers from image style variations caused by different cameras. The art implicitly addresses this problem by learning a camera-invariant descriptor subspace. In this paper, we explicitly consider this challenge by introducing camera style (CamStyle) adaptation. CamStyle can serve as a data augmentation approach that smooths the camera style disparities. Specifically, with CycleGAN, labeled training images can be style-transferred to each camera, and, along with the original training samples, form the augmented training set. This method, while increasing data diversity against over-fitting, also incurs a considerable level of noise. In the effort to alleviate the impact of noise, the label smooth regularization (LSR) is adopted. The vanilla version of our method (without LSR) performs reasonably well on few-camera systems in which over-fitting often occurs. With LSR, we demonstrate consistent improvement in all systems regardless of the extent of over-fitting. We also report competitive accuracy compared with the state of the art.

abstract: ['Cross-domain transfer learning (CDTL) is an extremely challenging task for the person re-identification (ReID). Given a source domain with annotations and a target domain without annotations, CDTL seeks an effective method to transfer the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. However, such a simple two-domain transfer learning method is unavailable for the person ReID in that the source/target domain consists of several sub-domains, e.g., camera-based sub-domains. To address this intractable problem, we propose a novel Many-to-Many Generative Adversarial Transfer Learning method (M2M-GAN) that takes multiple source sub-domains and multiple target sub-domains into consideration and performs each sub-domain transferring mapping from the source domain to the target domain in a unified optimization process. The proposed method first translates the image styles of source sub-domains into that of target sub-domains, and then performs the supervised learning by using the transferred images and the corresponding annotations in source domain. As the gap is reduced, M2M-GAN achieves a promising result for the cross-domain person ReID. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 show the effectiveness of our M2M-GAN.'],

In the baseline, we translate the labeled images from source to target domain in an unsupervised manner. We then train re-ID models with the translated images by supervised methods. Yet, being an essential part of this framework, unsupervised image-image translation suffers from the information loss of source-domain labels during translation. Our motivation is two-fold. First, for each image, the discriminative cues contained in its ID label should be maintained after translation. Second, given the fact that two domains have entirely different persons, a translated image should be dissimilar to any of the target IDs. To this end, we propose to preserve two types of unsupervised similarities, 1) self-similarity of an image before and after translation, and 2) domain-dissimilarity of a translated source image and a target image. Both constraints are implemented in the similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) which consists of an Siamese network and a CycleGAN. Through domain adaptation experiment, we show that images generated by SPGAN are more suitable for domain adaptation and yield consistent and competitive re-ID accuracy on two large-scale datasets.'],

abstract: ['Person re-identification (Re-ID) is an important task in video surveillance which automatically searches and identifies people across different cameras. Despite the extensive Re-ID progress in RGB cameras, few works have studied the Re-ID between infrared and RGB images, which is essentially a cross-modality problem and widely encountered in real-world scenarios. The key challenge lies in two folds, i.e., the lack of discriminative information to re-identify the same person between RGB and infrared modalities, and the difficulty to learn a robust metric for such a large-scale cross-modality retrieval. In this paper, we tackle the above two challenges by proposing a novel cross-modality generative adversarial network (termed cmGAN). To handle the lack of insufficient discriminative information, we design a cutting-edge generative adversarial training based discriminator to learn discriminative feature representation from different modalities. To handle the issue of large-scale cross-modality metric learning, we integrate both identification loss and cross-modality triplet loss, which minimize inter-class ambiguity while maximizing cross-modality similarity among instances. The entire cmGAN can be trained in an end-to-end manner by using standard deep neural network framework. We have quantized the performance of our work in the newly-released SYSU RGB-IR Re-ID benchmark, and have reported superior performance, i.e., Cumulative Match Characteristic curve (CMC) and Mean Average Precision (MAP), over the state-of-the-art works [Wu et al., 2017], at least 12.17{\%} and 11.85{\%} respectively.'],

It is challenging in 1) how to obtain more training data only from the training set and 2) how to use the newly generated data. In this work, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate unlabeled samples. We propose the label smoothing regularization for outliers (LSRO). This method assigns a uniform label distribution to the unlabeled images, which regularizes the supervised model and improves the baseline. We verify the proposed method on a practical problem: person re-identification (re-ID). This task aims to retrieve a query person from other cameras. We adopt the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) for sample generation, and a baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) for representation learning. Experiments show that adding the GAN-generated data effectively improves the discriminative ability of learned CNN embeddings. On three large-scale datasets, Market- 1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-reID, we obtain +4.37{\%}, +1.6{\%} and +2.46{\%} improvement in rank-1 precision over the baseline CNN, respectively.
